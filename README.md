## Welcome to Zucchini

Zucchini is an autograding collective - we maintain a number of open-source edtech platforms to make it easier to run large programming courses like Georgia Tech's CS 2110.

### Projects
- [zucchini][1], our flagship autograder software.
- [circuitsim-tester][2], a unit testing library for @ra4king's CircuitSim
- [pyLC3][3], a PyPI distribution of @TricksterGuy's pylc3, part of the complx LC-3 simulator suite.
- [seeds][4], a Python script that aligns scanned quiz papers using ArUco markers.
- [checkoff][5], a webapp that for taking attendance by reading student ID scans and entering attendance onto Google Sheets.
- [appel][6], a Python script that reads _checkoff_ sheets, applies attendance scoring rules and enters grades on Canvas.
- [novice][7], a future TypeScript-based LC-3 simulator.

### Other
- [cs2110-gba][8], a TA-curated archive of interesting GameBoy Advance game submissions from CS2110.
